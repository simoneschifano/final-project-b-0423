## Description

<p  align="left"> Crypie was born from the idea of providing users with a web application that differs from competitors thanks to its unique design. The design was designed totally from scratch using the "Adobe xd" tool, with mobile first in mind, following the UI/UX desing process. </p>
   <p align="left" > Using  <a style='color: rgb(255, 0, 230); text-decoration: none'href='https://www.coingecko.com/'     target='_blank' >CoinGecko</a>' API allows users to view a wide range of cryptocurrencies.  
   <br>
   <p>The use of the Next.js framework ensures that the app runs very quickly.
In order to minimize fetch calls to the API, a global state has been implemented. With a single fetch call you will have the data available on all pages of the app. </p>
